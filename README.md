# Hexcles' Configurations

My personal configurations(dotfile and etc).

## home

Mostly some dotfiles under home directory.

## etc

Some global configurations under /etc .

Most of them can be put under home as well(maybe need to rename). I put them in the /etc just because I have several accounts on my laptop and I want to make them the same. If you are on a server or a public workstation, it might be better to use personal configurations instead.
